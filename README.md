# Welcome to my GitHub :octocat:ðŸ‘‹!
## Projects and Guidelines  
Projects included on my GitHub repository are for my research projects which may or may not be made public.   
In terms of coding style, all code will follow the google style guide for the respective language where defined. Otherwise coding style will follow google-like syntax or the official documentation of that language. 

## Techstack
My research is in digital pathology image analysis, and involves the use of convolutional neural networks, predictive algorithms and statistics/data exploration. My main techstack is Python and SQL. In particular, I utilize the `tensorflow` and `scikit-learn` frameworks in my research. I have also used frameworks like `tidyverse`, `tidymodels`/`caret` for statistical analysis and predictive modelling.

All code follows the [google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.2-line-length) for Python.
